      details: `When I was first learning array methods, I spent a lot of time digging through the docs to find the appropriate one, and I had to search one by one. I made this resource to help people find the correct array method a bit more naturally. You can narrow down what you want to do and explore until you find what's most useful to you.

All of the code is MIT open source and hosted on github if you'd like to see how this is made: https://github.com/sdras/array-explorer/.`

      details: `I kept hearing about machine learning being used for evil and wanted to use it for something good. Social media posts typically don't have a way to enter alt text and the only users I see that reliably remember to add descriptions to the post are accessibility experts or blind people. Hopefully this allows good alt text to be a bit more ubiquitous.
